Since the code access your webcam you need to have Visual Studio Code and run the code through LiveServer!
Next install Firefox and make it as your defeault browers. 
Run the code and enjoy talking with the agent.
Curently the agent includes five questions and you can go through diffreent questions manually using your keyboard.
You can access them using your keyboard by simply pressing number 1 to 5.
After you heard each question simply press Enter, otherwise the agent would ask the question again and again. 
number 0 and number 6 on keyboard have secret functions! ;D
I would add the demo as soon as possbile.
